uCondition is a rule-based expression property type for Umbraco.  It allows content editors to control business logic directly within the Umbraco CMS.  It can be used to provide a more personalised experience to your customer, or to determine whether an action is permitted, or where ever you want to put the rules in to the hands of a content editor. 

You can download uCondition from Nuget.

This repository is a place for people to see premade predicates that can be used in your application.  It is also a place for you to contribute predicates too.
